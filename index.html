    <h1>BMI Calculator</h1>
    <div class="description">Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person.
         The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, 
        and is universally expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
        The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, 
        overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height. Commonly accepted BMI ranges
        are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), 
        ormal weight (18.5 to 25), overweight (25 to 30), and obese (over 30).</div>
